## Credit:
- This project uses the ```Google Charts``` javascript library. I give full credit to the creators and claim none of their work.

## Setup
 - Download Zip to run locally, or access the site from GitHub pages <a href="https://babyfeeder.github.io/" target="_blank">`babyfeeder-github.io`</a>
 - The baby log is stored using ```localStorage``` in the browser. User data will not sync across devices; once started, only use the exact same browser + device to be continue building the list/graph data (see 'Backup' section for help). 
 - When the user device/browser removes 'cookies and other browsing data', this will likely erase ehe localStorage for this app. Also, if the browser app undergoes an update, that may also wipe the data.

## Backup
 > Navigate to 'Backup' page

 > Download the ```.txt``` file

 > Import the file on a new device

This site has a backup and restore feature to save your baby logger charts. To export the user data, the 'Backup' page provides a button to download a ```.txt``` file. Send that file to another device and upload it through the file uploader in the new browser.
